    "text": "Dear Homeowner,\n\nLet's face it — the home improvement industry is broken in too many places.\n\nThe platforms that claim to \"check\" trades are failing. They've turned into auction sites, selling your job to the highest bidder without any real accountability. The result? Falling standards, frustrated homeowners, and too many people left out of pocket or disappointed with the work.\n\n**EvoHome Improvements was created to change that.**\n\nWe're not just another listing site — we're here to raise the standard across the UK by supporting quality installers and giving homeowners a smarter way to improve their homes. Our approach is built on trust, not transactions. We carefully vet every professional, offer real customer support, and give you clear, impartial advice so you can make confident decisions.\n\nIt's about matching the right person to the right project — and finding innovative ways to cut waste, save time, and unlock better value by securing exclusive deals with leading brands. That way, you don't just get any product — you get the best, without paying over the odds.\n\nEvoHome exists to protect homeowners, support skilled tradespeople, and restore pride to an industry that desperately needs it.\n\nThank you for considering us. If you're planning a project, we're here to make it easier, safer, and better from start to finish.\n\nSincerely,\nWilliam Bowry\nFounder & Director, EvoHome Improvements Ltd"
